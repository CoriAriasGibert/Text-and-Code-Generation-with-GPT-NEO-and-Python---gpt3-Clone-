GPT NEO and Python - gpt3 Clone in Jupyter ðŸ’»âœ¨ðŸ“œðŸ˜¸.

I explored these libraries to learn more about IA.

Huggingface ðŸ¤— platform has a large list of models open source in natural language processing, and a great documentation.

With this app you are able to generate either text in any language or code lines. Just start with a keyword or a short text as in the following example:

input : - what is art? output :- I have always been interested in art and literature, both as a professional artist and as a person with a passion and
strong sense of intellectual curiosity; however, it was only when my life changed that I began to really question...
or even:
input :- import numpy output :- import numpy as np import pandas as pd from sklearn.svm 
import LinearSVC from sklearn.lincomb import LinearRegression, LogisticRegression from sklearn.metrics 
import classification_report ...

Perfectly suitable for a chatbot, or to create contents for social networks ðŸ˜¸.
